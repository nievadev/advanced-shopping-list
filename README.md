# An advanced shopping list of courses
### Obviously it's dummy, it's not anything real
### Done with native JS, HTML and CSS

This project relies on localStorage to save the courses you have supposedly bought. <br>
It's yet on development, not finished.

# What did I gain?
**1**. Much more skill at programming with JavaScript<br>
**2**. Understood localStorage and sessionStorage concepts<br>
**3**. CSS Grids and Flexboxes!<br>
